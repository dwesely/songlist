9/7/2014	Who We Are, What We Do	Our annual Water Ingathering Service. The children will meet separately downstairs for their own water service with Rev. John and the RE leaders. They will join us at the end of the service as we mingle their water and ours and pour some of the combined waters on the butterfly garden. All are encouraged to bring water that represents those moments when your spirit was fed this last summer to share in common bowls. In preparation for that service, we invite you to reflect back this next week on the last few months. Was there a time in recent months when you felt yourself letting go of some old pain, healed, at peace at last -- ready to begin again? When you were in the presence of miracles of creation or beauty? When you felt connected with your family, some larger community or even earth itself? The water doesn’t need to be from the actual place itself. We will also have extra water present at the service for any who would like to participate. Water from this service is used throughout the year for various rituals such as baby and child dedications.	Come, Come, Whoever You Are, 188; Blue Boat Home, 1064
9/14/2014	Community -- Warm & Fuzzy or Cold & Hairy?	We tend to speak lovingly about the role community plays in our UU spiritual life, but community can often be hard and cruel. We leaern about ourselves, and we grow spiritually, by observing our roles in our religious communities.	We Give Thanks (#1010) led by the Children's Choir, Filled with Loving Kindness (#1031), Lean on Me (#1021)
9/21/2014	The Upside Down Church	We tend to think of the "church" as run by its leaders, with the help of committees. As members, we just tell them what we want. But could we see our job as making things happen, and our leaders' as empowering us, and maybe pointing the way? During this service, let's rethink church.	126-Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing; 218-Who Can Say; 311-Let it Be a Dance
9/28/2014	Only As good As the Shoes On My Feet	Ryan will share his personal story illustrating his journey in learning that emotions guide him but do not define him.	50-When Darness Nears; 95-There Is more Love Somewhere; 157-Step by Step the Longest March
10/5/2014	Listening to the Choir:  An Animal Blessing Service	Listening to the choir—An Animal Blessing Service.  Choir directors tell us to listen to the voices around us.  Each of the members of our great choir of creatures has something to teach us, something to give us.  Today we bless the creatures of our lives as they have blessed ours.	
10/12/2014	Be Here Now, Together	We are each on our own journey, and we must pull together and help each other, even if our destinations differ.	
10/19/2014	Surprised by Joy	Eight short years ago, when Virginia passed its anti-gay amendments, we lamented that we might not live to see them changed. Now, less than a decade later, we’re surprised by joy as they’ve collapsed. We take time this morning to celebrate, even as we continue to press that arc of the moral universe which, Theodore Parker famously reminded us, is long, but bends toward justice. We’ve postponed today’s planned service on Parker’s life.  	410 Surprised by Joy, 30 Over My Head, 168 One More Step
10/26/2014	Of, By, and For All the People	Inspired by our faith tradition's insistence on democratic process, Unitarian minister Theodore Parker in 1852 called on government to be as above. Abraham Lincoln's edited Gettysburg Address version of Parker's words became the definition of democracy the world over, inspiring almost all by its just and hopeful call.  Coming from this heritage, today we are faced with the  immense, urgent moral issue of climate change. We need like never before the full wisdom, accountability, inspiration, and strength that lived democratic process provides us.  And we need each one of us, for, as Susan B. Anthony once put it, "Failure is impossible."	21-For the Beauty of the Earth; 1011-Return Again; 1064-Blue Boat Home
11/2/2014	We Remember Them	Today is “All Souls” Sunday, a time for remembering loved ones who are with us now only in memory.

You’re welcome also to bring pictures. 	359 When We Are Gathered; 191 Now I Recall My Childhood; 354 We Laugh, We Cry
11/9/2014	Slipping Anchor	Have you ever had your spiritual beliefs challenged by life's vagaries? What  happened? How did you cope? Did it affect your spiritual journey?  	1064-Blue Boat Home; 123-Spirit of Life; 97-Sometimes I feel like a Motherless Child
11/16/2014	To Bless and Be Blessed	 From the day of our birth to the day of our death, we are blessed with so many gifts not of our own making. Many of them in disguise. Many of them hard won. Today we speak of the blessings in our lives and of how we in turn are a blessing in others lives.  	Gather the spirit 347, Voice still and small 391, My Live Flows On in Endless Song 108
11/23/2014	An Attitude of Gratitude	Gratitude is a spiritual discipline. Gratitude can be the hallmark of a robust Unitarian Universalism. It can be as difficult for some folks to say or hear “thank you” as it is “forgive me.” Join us in a service where we will explore how to nurture grateful hearts and embody an attitude of gratitude.	1071-On the Dusty Earth Drum; 128-For All That Is Our Life;
11/30/2014	Keeping the Faith	Keeping the Faith" - Shakespeare wrote: “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players…”. But are we “merely” players? We all play important roles in the world, and in each others’ lives, so how can we best apply our faith in the “theatrical production” of our lives?  	108-My Life Flows On in Endless Song; 396-I Know This Rose Will Open; 131-Love Will Guide Us
12/7/2014	Build a Cradle	As a couple awaited the birth of their first grandchild, the husband felt disappointed. He just wasn't excited. His wife replied, "Build a cradle!"

1/11/2015	We've Been Waiting for You	As we welcome friends this morning, we’ll share a wonderful story in which the ship carrying the Englishman who brought Universalism to this country runs aground on the New Jersey shore.  Disembarking, he encounters a farmer who tells him, “I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”  Bring a friend as we explore some fascinating history of our religious roots – and our ongoing Universalist message of welcome for everyone.	360 Here We Have Gathered; 188 Come, Come, Whoever You Are; 1028 The Fire of Commitment
1/18/2015	Racial Justice 2015 - Letting Our Little Lights Shine	Today, Rev. Hubbell invites members and friends to look at racial justice right here in Loudoun County.

2/15/2015	Words that Hurt, Words that Heal	A lot of problems are a result of what comes out of our mouths. We say things when we are tired or hurt or angry. Sometimes we are unaware; sometimes we are aware of the likely impact yet say hurtful things anyway. How can we work through our mess-ups, bring healing, and try to avoid the same mistakes in the future?  	1010-We Give Thanks; 1008-When Our Heart Is in a Holy Place; 1007 There's a River Flowin' in My Soul
2/22/2015	Ignorance to Bliss	A personal journey through ignorance is explored.	354-We Laugh, We Cry; Peace Train; Getting to Know You

3/15/2015	History as a Spiritual Practice	As participants in liberal religion, it is important for congregations to know their history: the history of their own congregation adn the wider history of Unitarians and Universalists. Engaging in history is both informative and healing, connecting us with the past and informing our steps into the future. Today we will consider how history can be understood as spiritual practice.	1003-Where Do We Come From; 391-Voice Still and Small; 114-Forward through the Ages

How did they accomplish this and what does their example mean to us today - their heirs in this building?	361-Enter, Rejoice, and Come In; 121; 121-We'll Build a Land
4/5/2015	Easter: History or Experience	Too easily we dismiss the Easter story as impossible. It just could not have happened! But in a larger sense, resurrection happens every day. And it can happen to us!	61:  Lo the Earth Awakes Again; 38:  Morning has Broken; 270:  O Day of Light and Gladness
4/12/2015	The Community Garden	Gardens require our attention, patience, love and care to produce their abundance.

4/19/2015	Letting Go of What You Know	Much of human life and community is defined by what we "know", and yet liberal faith calls us to engaging the things we know with the spirit of a seeker. How do we hold knowledge and beliefs firmly enough to grasp and yet lightly enough to change?	354-We Laugh, We Cry; 352-Find a Stillness; 1064-Blue Boat Home

5/10/2015	Investing in Your Beliefs	Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), Strategic Sustainable Investing (SSI), Impact Investing (II) are variations on a theme: aligning your investment capital with your principles.

But making the right choices to do that is not as easy as it may seem.	1-May Nothing Evil Cross This Door; 34-Though I May Speak wih Bravest Fire; 121- We'll Build a Land
5/17/2015	Touch the Earth, Reach the Sky	This year's Auction sermon (won by Religious Education teacher and children's choir director, Carol Harkrader Pine) is a reflection on nurturing our children's spiritual growth.

5/31/2015	Waiting for Wings	Mental illness plagues many in our families, congregations and communities.

6/7/2015	Reflections on our Beloved Community	Our Covenant calls upon us to be guided by the spirit of love, and to quest for truth. The 4th principle of our faith – a free and responsible search for truth and meaning – reinforces the importance of a quest for truth, yet our seven cherished UU principles are silent on the topic of love. How can the “spirit of love” and the “quest for truth” guide the governance of our beloved community?  	Gather the Spirit #347 We Would Be One #318 Here We Have Gathered #360 
6/14/2015	Walking Together	Unitarian Universalists belong to a “covenantal” faith tradition: we choose our religion. We choose our leaders, and we’re bound together by a moral commitment – a “covenant” – to “walk together” in a spirit of love. We say this every Sunday. But do we really mean it? And what does it mean, anyway?  	311 Let It Be a Dance; 1031 Filled with Loving Kindness; 1028 The Fire of Commitment
6/21/2015	On Assembling Your Personal Collection of Sacred Inspiration	Where do you turn to for comfort, inspiration, and guidance? The loose leaf spiritual collection is an idea of the Rev. Bruce Southworth that he calls his loose leaf bible. Maintaining one is a fulfilling spiritual practice. The idea of a loose leaf collection means that additions, subtractions and revisions are always possible. Generally it contains not your own writings, but words of others that are inspiring, comforting, spiritually enlightening. If we are all responsible for building our own theology, why not build our own spiritual writing collection as well. 	389 Gathered Here; 123 Spirit of Life; 21 For the Beauty of the Earth
6/28/2015	The Great Deception	Stories play an important role in our cultural identity. Our truths we take from a story depend on our individual perspective. While stories like the Biblical Creation story can be divisive, if we take time to reframe our understanding of a story, we might find a universal wisdom that helps unify differing ideologies, rather than wedge them apart.Even though or ideologies are different, are common human goals are the same.  	207-Earth Was Given as a Garden; 100-I've Got Peace Like a River; 401-Kum ba Yah
7/5/2015	The Real Story of America	In Selma on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Obama answered those who say America’s “exceptionalism” exempts us from criticism.  “What greater form of patriotism is there,” he asked, “than the belief that America is not yet finished?” In last week's marriage decision, unthinkable only a decade ago, the Supreme Court seemed to agree. On this Independence Day weekend, we celebrate America’s true exceptionalism -- our commitment to an ever more perfect union.  	172-Siph' Amandla (O God, Give Us Power); #1053-How Could Anyone?; 170-We Are a Gentle, Angry People

8/30/2015	My Looseleaf Bible	We all know the commercial that ends: "What's in your wallet?" Today, we wrap up the summer services and ask: "What's in your Bible?" Mel shares some of his items to get you started on an answer.	23 - Bring Many Names; 108 - My Life Flows On in Endless Song; 311 - Let It Be a Dance
