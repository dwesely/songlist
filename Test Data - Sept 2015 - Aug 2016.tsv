9/6/2015	Labor in Loudoun: A Panel Discussion	This unique Labor Day program will feature short presentations by four Loudoun Leaders: John Stevens, Crossroads Jobs; Katie Hammler (Leesburg Town Council); Elizabeth Hodge (Director of VOA); and Marty Martinez (Leesburg Town Council). Time will be provided in the program for Q&A by the congregation -- as well as the usual coffee hour opportunities. Frank Shipp's talents will call us to community, as UUCL continues to contemplate its role in Loudoun's own web of interdependence.	126-Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing	
9/13/2015	Deep Calls Unto Deep	From time immemorial, water has symbolized birth and renewal. Today we continue our custom of bringing tokens of water from places where we have experienced renewal – waters drawn from the ocean or a lake or a river, or even rainwater or tap water.  This year we’ll share in silence, against a background of renewing water scenes. We’ll have extra water available, if needed.  	210-Wade in the Water; 1064 Blue Boat Home; 4-I Brought My Spirit to the Sea	
9/20/2015	Black Lives Matter	Unitarian Universalists affirm in the inherent worth and dignity of all people. Surely that includes black people. Yet today, Rev. Hubbell reflects on the need to proclaim loudly and clearly that Black Lives Matter.	153 Oh, I Woke Up This Morning; 146 Soon the Day Will Arrive; 108 My Life Flows on in Endless Song	
9/27/2015	Whole Living and Our Money: Making the Connection	Explore spirituality and money. Consider the role of money in our lives from a different perspective.  	16 Tis a Gift to be Simple; 128 For All That is Our Life	
10/4/2015	Keep the Cake	What ever happened to aggreeing to disagree?  When did it become acceptable, in fact almost expected, to endeavor to ruin the lives of those who believe differently than you do?  Is there a way to coexist peacefully and respect each other?  	170-We Are a Gentle, Angry People; 86-Blessed Spirit of My Life; 131-Love Will Guide Us	
10/11/2015	Alive With Love	Churches today are hemhorrhaging members.  As UUs we're barely holding our own.  How is a church for the 21st century to reach a generation that's "spiritual but not religious" -- unless it's alive with love?	347 Gather the Spirit; 8 Mother Spirit, Father Spirit; 121 We'll Build a Land	
10/18/2015	Changes	How does change impact our lives? We sometimes welcome change and other times it is intrusive and can be a disruption. How does change in our lives not only affect us but also those around us - our families, our friends, our communities and our church.  		
10/25/2015	A Faith that Matters	Fewer people today are going to church. Yet whether we are young or old, we still daily encounter concerns about life and death, justice, compassion – traditional themes of churches. Today, Rev. Phyllis continues the theme Rev. John introduced in his recent sermon on the church in the twenty-first century.	“Let It Be a Dance” #311; “Spirit of Life #123; “Building a new Way” #1017	
11/1/2015	Even These Things May Seem Pleasant	Will we ever look back on today's tragedies and find them pleasant? Seems unlikely, but a quotation suggesting that from Vergil's "Aeneid" is still discussed by Latin scholars -- and was tattooed on Thomas Harkrader Pine's arm years before he died. Was he leaving us a message? Do the dead send us messages in more than the figurative sense?	180 Alhamdulillah; 51 Lady of the Seasons' Laughter; 95 There Is More Love Somewhere 	
11/8/2015	Oh, the Ravens and the Steelers Should be Friends	It’s not just opposing football teams. Everyone seems to be angry -- Christians, Muslims, atheists. Republicans, Democrats, Tea Party members. Revs. Phyllis and John speak about finding compassion and respect for those we consider our enemies. We invite those of you who are sports fans to dress up for the occasion. Come with your sweatshirts, t-shirts, hats. Paint your faces, wear your wigs, and hold up your signs.	368, Now Let Us Sing, 1002, Comfort Me, 318 We Would be One	
11/15/2015	With Conviction	Rev. Anya Sammler-Michael joins us today on a Pulpit Swap Sunday for Northern VA congregations. Rev. Anya, who strives for understanding and works to honor the inherent worth and dignity in every person, reflects today on the ideologies that she cannot abide and will not support.	1010-We Give Thanks; 396-I Know This Rose Will Open; 1040-Hush	
11/22/2015	Simple Gifts	Sometimes we get so caught up in what we want, that we overlook what we have. As we enter this season of Thanksgiving, we take time to give thanks for the simple gifts of life – the gift of life itself, the gifts of family and friendship and love, the abundance of earth and life alike, and the sun and the moon and the stars.	16-'Tis a Gift to Be Simple; 128-For All That Is Our Life; 1010-Oh, We Give Thanks	
11/29/2015	Accepting Change? Embracing Change!		123-Spirit of Life; 396-I Know This Rose Will Open	
12/6/2015	Love Never Dies	Holidays are particularly difficult for those who have lost loved ones. Today we seek comfort in our Unitarian Universalist faith to help us through the hard times.	340-Though Gathered Here to Celebrate; 123-Spirit of Life; 101-Abide with Me	
12/13/2015	Santa Lucia	Celebrated on December 13, the darkest time of the year, Santa Lucia’s Day originated in Scandinavian countries, and  commemorates the charitable work of St. Lucy (or Santa Lucia), an Italian martyr known for her compassion and generous nature. Like many winter holiday traditions, Santa Lucia’s Day embodies a spirit of giving as well as a feeling of community.	235-Deck the Hall with Boughs of Holly; 226-People, Look East;  	
12/20/2015	Winter Solstice Service	Join the UUCL music team as they guide us through a celebration of the darkness and the light with songs and stories

12/24/2015 Christmas Eve	the Gift of the Magi	Revs. Hubbell and Manwell will present their own adaptation of O’Henry’s story, “The Gift of the Magi.”  O’Henry’s story tells of two young people with more love than money who want to give each other their heart’s desire for Christmas. Come and warm your heart as we sing the carols of the season, closing with a candle-lit “Silent Night.	253-O Come, All Ye Faithful; 254-Sing We Now of Christmas; 256-We Three Kings;246-O Little Town of Bethlehem; 251-Silent Night, Holy Night	
12/27/2015	Holiday memories	Today we look at our holiday memories, both lonely and sweet: Our first time away from home, and a welcome far away; loved ones no longer at our table, and new arrivals; traditions both old and new. With seasonal scenes in the background, we’ll share stories of the season, and familiar songs, as we see Christmas through each other’s eyes as a season of coming together across both time and distance.	259 We Three Kings; 30 Over My Head; 395 Sing and Rejoice	ONE service at 10am
1/3/2016	Personal Journeys	Three of our newer members will tell us of their paths to Unitarian Universalism.		Similar to last year, Allan will recruit new members to speak
1/10/2016	Be Not Afraid	Sound biblical? It is. But still at the heart of our UU message: Be not afraid -- of the stranger; of change; of the unknown; of failure. We try to live from love and from trust, try to midwife change even when the way is clouded and we may fail. As we begin a new year, let’s reflect on our fears and our longings.	28-View the Starry Realm; 396-I Know This Rose Will Open; 131-Love Will Guide Us	
1/17/2016	Yearning to Breathe Free	Today, in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, we stop to ask ourselves where we are called to stand in responding to the huge number of people fleeing poverty and assault who “yearn to breathe free.”	# 131 Love Will Guide Us , #1031 Filled with Loving Kindness, # 121 We’ll Build a Land”	
1/24/2016	Being, Doing, Sharing the Principles: Conscious, Deliberate and Hard	Being, Doing, Sharing the Principles: Conscious, deliberate and hard. Chaplain James Gibbons Walker will look at our First Principle (inherent worth and dignity) and invite consideration on what each of us can do each day to embody, enact, and evangelize about this value at the heart of our liberal faith.	67-We Sing Now Together; 112-Do You Hear?; 118-This Little Light of Mine;	
1/31/2016	The Lone, Wild Bird	We come together out of our longing for oneness with all that is -- ourselves, others, the universe itself, some would say with God. We imagine ourselves as the "lone, wild bird" of our song, soaring high and far, yet always at one with the spirit which joins all life. How, in our time, can the church best respond? 	15 The Lone, Wild Bird; 83 Winds Be Still; 295-Sing Out Praises for the Journey	
2/7/2016	Love Stories	Valentine’s Day is coming soon. Today, Rev. Hubbell shares some love stories. Bring your hankies and join us on reflecting on spirituality and relationships.  	1010 We Give Thanks, 34 Though I Speak with Bravest Fire.	
2/14/2016	Plato's Three Loves	We all feel different kinds of love all the time, different when we’re talking about our friends, our spouse, our kids, our church members…our  enemies….Come to this Valentine’s Day service and take a look at the three different kinds of love that Plato talked about. Which one do we need the most in church?	131-Love Will Guide Us; 123-Spirit of Life; 129-Let Love Continue Long	We all feel different kinds of love all the time, different when we’re talking about our friends, our spouse, our kids, our church members…our  enemies….Come to this Valentine’s Day service and take a look at the three different kinds of love that Plato talked about. Which one do we need the most in church?
2/21/2016	Giving Our Hearts, Sharing Our Lives	As we enter the season of stewardship, we reflect this morning on who we are. We remember that it’s not about us, as individuals, supporting an institution, separate from us. In our stewardship we’re giving to each other, and to ourselves. We’re giving our hearts. We’re giving our lives. We’re building our dreams.	128-For All That Is our Life; 402--From You I Receive; 311-Let It Be a Dance	
2/28/2016		Muslim faith		Bob Marro (rmarro@cox.net) will be speaker.  Alternate contact person is Rizwan Jaka (rojpm@yahoo.com)
3/6/2016	religUUsity	When you take a survey and get asked how religious you are, how do you answer? Do you see yourself as different from those churchgoers? Mel has rethought his answers and wants you to, too.	#8 Mother Spirit, Father Spirit, #205 Amazing Grace! #210 Wade in the Water	 
3/13/2016	Why I Am a Unitarian Universalist	Many religious paths exist that help millions of people find grounding and meaning in their lives. Thirty years ago, I became a Unitarian Universalist. Today, nearing the end of my active ministry, I would like to reflect on why I am a Unitarian Universalist.	#347, Gather the Spirit, # 188 Come, Come, Whoever You Are, #123, Spirit of Life, # 1017, We Are Building a New Way, (alt) # 287 Faith of the Larger Liberty.	
3/20/2016	Have You Taken Your Placebo Today?	The urge to heal ourselves is a common desire, whether we frame it in terms of healing the mind, the body, or the spirit. Placebos DO work to some degree: to be considered effective, a medicine needs to have a positive effect that is better than the placebo effect. How can we harness this placebo power and other tools for healing ourselves?	# 324 Where My Free Spirit Onward Leads, #123 Spirit of Life, #205 Amazing Grace	
3/27/2016	I Will Be With You Always	The Gospel of Matthew ends with the risen Jesus assuring his disciples that “I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Our rational selves may scoff, but many find comfort in these words. This Easter Sunday, what might they mean for us? 	61 Lo, the Earth Awakes Again; 395 Sing and Rejoice; 269 Lo, the Day of Days Is Here	
4/3/2016	Because of You	This is UUCL's 25th anniversary. This morning we reflect on the  difference UUCL has made, is making, and will make in the years to come.	118 This Little Light of Mine, 146 Soon the Day Will Arrive, 318 We Would Be One	  
4/10/2016	Oh No...H20	Back in the twentieth century, the United Nations declared that "The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses."  How can this right still be denied, in the twenty-first century, in the wealthiest country on the planet?	TENTATIVE: 1064-Blue Boat Home; The Water is Wide   	Children's Choir
4/17/2016	Brother Eagle, Sister Sky	Celebrate our Mother Earth through song and story	 	Childrens Choir
4/24/2016	Pyramid or Circle?	With Earth Day fresh in mind, we look this morning at our human place on our planet. Do we rule from atop a pyramid, or can we reimagine ourselves as part of a great circle of life, an interdependent web? Our sermon topic is posed by Tommy Chambers, winning bidder at last year’s auction.  	203-All Creatures of the Earth and Sky; 207-Earth Was Given as a Garden; 83-Winds Be Still  	
5/1/2016	Have You Checked Your Faith Recently?	Have you checked your faith recently? Leslie Wright and Glenda Parsons will present a service on Faith. After watching a Ted Talk with the adult worship committee discussion group, we checked in with our faith, those beliefs we had faith in. The faith that we relied on to help us make sense of our life and our place in it. For both of us, our faith had changed without either of us quite being aware of it.	#347-Gather the Spirit; #396-I Know This Rose Will Open; #311-Let It Be a Dance	
5/8/2016	Finding Spirituality While Changing the World	Many of us long for more spirituality in our lives. Many of us long to end hunger, homelessness, inequality. Today, Rev. Hubbell reflects on how we might find both in building the most unlikely relationships.	1010-We Give Thanks; 123-Spirit of Life; 1008; When Our Heart Is in a Holy Place	
5/15/2016	Adult Training Camp: What I Learned from UU Youth and Young Adults	How do we minister to and with UU youth and young adults?  They are our present and our future, so what are their needs, and are they different from older generations?  	301-Touch the Earth, Reach the Sky!; 1021-Lean on Me; 1074-Turn the World Around (alternate 354-We Laugh, We Cry"	
5/22/2016	A Community of Hope	It has been said that deep down, every minister has just one sermon. So for my last solo sermon in our five years with you, and as you reflect on your own core identity, I want to draw on the sermon with which I began my ministry 26 years ago, in Canada. It’s about the church as a community of hope.	360 Here we have gathered; 346 Come, Sing a Song with me; 1023 Building Bridges	
5/29/2016	We Already Have Everything We Need	Becoming a Perfect Buddha
